# minilibX

Simplified graphic programming interface for beginners

This is the native version of minilibX for MacOSX.

[It no longer uses X11 graphics libraries, nor XQuartz the X server for MacOSX. ]

The interface / API, remains identical to the previous version. The man is present in the minilibX and is valid.

This version uses MacOSX's Cocoa window system (AppKit), and basic modern OpenGL graphics.
